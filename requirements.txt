# Design Doc: File Organization Tool

> Please DON'T remove notes for AI

## Requirements

> Notes for AI: Keep it simple and clear.
> If the requirements are abstract, write concrete user stories

1. As a user, I want to categorize files from a source directory into a destination directory based on file type, creation date, and last modified date.
2. As a user, I want the system to handle name conflicts by renaming files appropriately.
3. As a user, I want to generate HTML and CSV reports of the organized files.

## Flow Design

> Notes for AI:
> 1. Consider the design patterns of agent, map-reduce, rag, and workflow. Apply them if they fit.
> 2. Present a concise, high-level description of the workflow.

### Applicable Design Pattern:

1. **Map** the files from the source directory into categorized chunks based on file type and date.
2. **Reduce** these chunks into the destination directory while handling name conflicts.
3. **Agentic report generator** to create HTML and CSV reports.

### Flow high-level Design:

1. **File Categorization Node**: This node categorizes files based on type and date.
2. **Conflict Resolution Node**: This node handles name conflicts during file organization.
3. **Report Generation Node**: This node generates HTML and CSV reports of the organized files.
